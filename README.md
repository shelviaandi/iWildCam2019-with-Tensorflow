# iWildCam2019-with-Tensorflow
This Project is a part of Bangkit final project.  
Bangkit is a Google-led academy developed in collaboration with Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka. It was conducted in the early 2020 until mid-year 2020.

# Dataset
The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/iwildcam-2019-fgvc6) 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Several data pre-processing and augmentation techniques are explored at EDA_iwildcam2019_BangkitProject.ipynb

# Model Selection
CNN baseline can be found at CNN Baseline - iwildcam2019.ipynb. Another file Fine_Tuning_CNN_Baseline_iwildcam2019.ipynb is used to try several techniques in convolutional NN.
Pretrained model can be found ta Deeper_TL_iWildCam2019_EffNetLite_B0.ipynb.

# Presentation
Presentation slides can be found at pdf file
